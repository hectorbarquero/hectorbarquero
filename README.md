## About me
[Digital Extremes](https://www.digitalextremes.com/) Senior technical writer by day, programmer by night.

I'm currently building developer documentation for the Evolution Engine™, a graphics engine powering the AAA game <i>Warframe</i>™. 

I'm a process automation specialist who builds tools and workflows that bridge file formats, streamline publishing, and eliminate manual bottlenecks between systems that aren’t designed to communicate with each other. From CLI tools and plugins to full systems, I help teams focus on high-value work, not on repetitive tasks.
